The Spring 1987 issue of Informix's Tech Notes had an article on Outer
Joins.  The content of that article is the basis of the version 4.0
appendix with minimal changes for the altered context, such as omitting
a reference to the next article in the Tech Notes which was on query
optimization.

This is a transcription and translation into HTML of an ancient
document, namely Appendix G (Complex Outer Joins) from the Informix-4GL
Reference Manual, Vol 2, Version 1.10 (part number 200-507-0002-0, dated
July 1988).  It is referring to Informix's OUTER construct, not the ISO
9075:1992 SQL standard construct with the same name but a radically
different syntax.  The ISO (ANSI) outer join notation is available IDS
7.31 and in IDS.2000 9.21.  Also, the document uses the term RDSQL to
refer to the database server.  The original version of this document
dates back to the days before SE and Turbo were separate products, when
you bought Informix-4GL or Informix-SQL and the database process,
sqlexec (which became the core of SE) was simply an important part of
the base product.

<H2> Complex Outer Joins </H2>

When more than two table participate in an outer join, there are many
ways in which to relate them.  For three tables, there are five
logically distinct joins, of which four involve outer joins.  These
distinct outer joins are listed later in this appendix, using the
notation to be used in SELECT statements and a graphic notation that can
be generalized for any number of tables.  The detailed rules for the
graphic representation are located at the end of this section.  Briefly,
the subservient tables are placed on a lower level than dominant tables.

<P>
The two-table outer join described in Chapter 2 <i>[of the I4GL
Reference Manual, Volume 1]</i> is graphically represented as follows:
</P>

<P>
In the examples that follow, the tilde (~) symbol represents any Boolean
relation between the columns of two tables.

<H3> Example 1 </H3>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
    FROM x, y, z
    WHERE ...

<I>Diagram</I>
x ---- y ---- z         Level 1
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>
This is the standard inner join and all three tables are treated on the
same level.  There are no restrictions on the WHERE clause.  It need not
exist.  Before the WHERE clause is applied, a full Cartesian product is
made among all three tables.  (<B>Note</b>: A Cartesian product of two
tables appends every row of the second table to every row of the first.
A Cartesian product of three tables is the Cartesian product of the
third with the Cartesian product of the first two, and so on.)
</P>

<H3> Example 2 </H3>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
    FROM x, y, OUTER z
    WHERE (x or y) ~ z

<I>Diagram</I>
x ---- y -----@         Level 1
              |
              z         Level 2
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

Example 2 illustrates the simplest extension of the outer join from two
tables to three tables. <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are joined at the same
level and are shown connected together. <b>z</b> is the subservient
table and is placed down one level.  The WHERE clause must relate a
Level 1 table with a Level 2 table.  Other relationships are also
permitted.  Before the WHERE clause is applied, RDSQL takes the
cartesian product of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> and then takes the outer join
of the result with z. <b>x</b>

<H3> Example 3 </H3>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
    FROM x, OUTER y, OUTER z
    WHERE x ~ y AND x ~ z

<I>Diagram</I>
x -----@------@         Level 1
       |      |
       y      z         Level 2
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

Although both <b>y</b> and <b>z</b> are at the same level, they are not
connected.  Here, a relationship is required between <b>x</b> and
<b>y</b> and also between <b>x</b> and <b>z</b>.  No relationship is
permitted between <b>y</b> and <b>z</b> since they are not connected at
the second level.  The outer join is performed between <b>x</b> and
<b>y</b> and then the outer join between the resulting table and
<b>z</b>.

<H3> Example 4 </H3>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
    FROM x, OUTER (y, z)
    WHERE x ~ (y or z)

<I>Diagram</I>
x -----@                Level 1
       |
       y ---- z         Level 2
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

In Example 4, a relationship is required between <b>x</b> and either
<b>y</b> or <b>z</b> or both.  In addition, there may be a relationship
between <b>y</b> and <b>z</b> since they are connected at the second
level.  To perform this join, RDSQL starts at the top and works down.
For each row of <b>x</b>, RDSQL attempts to find a row of <b>y</b> that
satisfies the WHERE clause.  If none is found, RDSQL substitutes NULL
values for the columns of <b>y</b> and <b>z</b>.  If a row of <b>y</b>
satisfies the WHERE clause, RDSQL seeks a row of <b>z</b> that satisfies
the WHERE clause.  It substitutes NULL values for both <b>y</b> and
<b>z</b> if no row in <b>z</b> is found.

<H3> Example 5 </H3>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
    FROM x, OUTER (y, OUTER z)
    WHERE x ~ y AND y ~ z

<I>Diagram</I>
x -----@                Level 1
       |
       y -----@         Level 2
              |
              z         Level 3
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>
Example 5 shows a three-level outer join.  There must always be a
relationship between adjacent levels.  In this case, <b>x</b> must be
related to <b>y</b>, and <b>y</b> must be related to <b>z</b>.  RDSQL
performs this join by picking a row from <b>x</b> and looking for a pair
from <b>y</b> and <b>z</b> that satisfies (<b>y</b>, outer <b>z</b>).

<P>
The following steps are useful when considering how RDSQL performs an outer join:

<OL>
<LI>
Draw the graph corresponding to the FROM clause.  Replace each keyword
OUTER with the symbol @ and put the table names to which the keyword
applies in the next lower level.

<LI>
Ensure that a condition exists in the WHERE clause relating a table on
each level through each @ to a table in the next level below.

<LI>
Form a Cartesian product of all tables connected on the same level,
applying whichever conditions of the WHERE clause apply only to that
level.

<LI>
Starting with the first level, take a row at a time from the resulting
table and attempt to satisfy the WHERE clause with the resulting table
of the next lower level, replacing the columns of the lower-level table
with NULL values if the WHERE clause cannot be satisfied.
</OL>

As an example, the following FROM clause results in the accompanying graph:

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
    FROM x, OUTER (y, OUTER (z, a, b)), outer c, d
</PRE></CODE>

<CODE><PRE>
x -----@-------------@----- d   Level 1
       |             |
       y ---- @      c          Level 2
              |
              z ---- a ---- b   Level 3
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

A Cartesian product is made between <b>x</b> and <b>d</b> (call it
<b>txd</b>) and between <b>z</b>, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> (call it
<b>tzab</b>), since these sets of tables are connected on the same
level. <b>y</b> and <b>c</b> are both on Level 2, but they are not
connected on that level.  For each row of <b>txd</b>, RDSQL attempts to
find a row of <b>y</b> that satisfies the WHERE clause.  If it succeeds,
it searches for a row of <b>tzab</b> that satisfies the WHERE clause.
In both cases, NULL values are substituted if no satisfactory row is
found.  RDSQL then searches for a row of <b>c</b> that satisfies the
WHERE clause, substituting NULL values if unsuccessful.

<H2> Outer Joins </H2>

This appendix discusses the difference between a simple join and an
outer join, and describes in detail how outer joins work.  The following
SELECT statements illustrate the basic difference between the two types
of join.

Both query the same tables (<B>customer</b> and <B>orders</B>) of the
same database (<B>stores</B>) through a join on the same column
(<B>customer_num</B>).  At first glance, both fetch the same data.  The
query results, however, are quote different, as the following

<P>
By using a <I>simple join</i>, Query 1 fetches a list of only those
customers who have items on order, while Query 2 fetches a list of all
customers by using an <i>outer</i> join.  Once you understand how
similar queries can produce such dissimilar results, you can begin to
use outer joins effectively.  The obvious differences between the two
joins are as follows:
</P>

<P>
<BL>
<LI>
A <i>simple join</i> discards all rows that do not satisfy the join condition.
<LI>
An <i>outer join</i> preserves rows that would otherwise be discarded.
</BL>

</P>
<P>
The following section discusses outer joins in detail.
</P>

<H2> How Outer Joins Work </H2>

<P>
A join queries two or more tables as though they were one.  It is as if
4GL creates and then acts upon a single temporary table to produce the
query results.  4GL does not actually create such a table to perform a
join, but it is helpful to conceptualize a join in these terms.
</P>

<P>
In a simple two-table join, the resulting "table" contains only those
combinations of rows from both tables that satisfy the join condition.
In an outer join, the resulting "table" contains these rows, plus all
the remaining rows from on of the tables, called the dominant (or
preserved) table.  The second table is called the subservient table.
</P>

<P>
Consider two hypothetical tables, <B>employees</B> and <B>depts</B>,
which contain the following columns and rows (where dash '--' indicates
a NULL value):
</P>

<CODE><PRE>
employees

emp_num     dept_num
2           105
4           103
6           103
5           --
3           102

depts

depts_num   dept_loc

102         NY
103         LA
105         SF

</PRE></CODE>

<P>
Suppose, for example, that you need a list of employee numbers and
department locations for all employees, including those employees whose department locations are unknown
(represented by NULL values in the <B>employees</B> table).  The following query fetches the desired results:
</P>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT emp_num, dept_loc
    FROM employees, OUTER depts
    WHERE employees.dept_num = depts.dept_num
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>
The keyword OUTER designates <b>depts</b> as the subservient table,
making <B>employees</B> the dominant table.  4GL processes the query by
the following steps:

<OL>
<LI>
4GL applies filters to the subservient table while sequentially applying
the join condition to the rows of the dominant table.  Rows in the
dominant table are retrieved without considering the join, but rows from
the subservient table (outer table) are retrieved only if they satisfy
the join condition.  Any dominant-table rows that do not have a matching
row from the subservient table receive a row of NULL values in place of
a subservient-table row.
</P>

<P>
The result is a "table" with the following rows:

</P>
<CODE><PRE>
emp_num     dept_num    dept_num    dept_loc
2           105         105         SF

<P>
Note: A <i>filter</i> is a condition expressed in a WHERE clause that
applies to columns in a single table.  For example,
</P>

<CODE><PRE>
dept_loc  = "SF"        <i>or</i>          emp_num < 105
</PRE></CODE>

<P>
Because 4GL applies such filters to the subservient table as it performs
the join, the resulting "table" may contain NULL values that were not
present in the subservient table prior to the join.
</P>
<P>
Suppose that the query include a filter on the <b>dept_loc</b> column:
</P>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT emp_num, dept_loc
    FROM employees, OUTER depts
    WHERE employees.dept_num = depts.dept_num
      AND dept_loc != "LA"
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>
At step 2, the results include more rows of NULL values than the results
of the original query:
</P>

<CODE><PRE>
emp_num     dept_loc
2           SF
4           --
6           --
5           --
3           NY
</PRE></CODE>

<P>
The filter removes rows from the <b>depts</b> table where
<b>dept_loc</b> is equal to "LA".

<LI>
After performing the join, 4Gl applies filters to the dominant table (if
they exist).

<LI>
4GL applies the SELECT clause to eliminate unneeded columns, and the
query returns the results:


<CODE><PRE>
emp_num     dept_loc
2           SF
4           LA
6           LA
5
3           NY
</PRE></CODE>

<P>
<SMALL><I>
The original version listed the <b>emp_num</b> values in numeric order
without any sorting.  IDS.2000 does not do this.
</I></SMALL>

</OL>

<P>
In a similar way to the previous example, the following query produces a
list of all customers with supplemental information for those customers
with items on orders.  Where <b>orders.customer_num</b> is not equal to
<b>customer.customer_num</b>, 4GL combines a row of NULL values with the
corresponding row from the <b>customer</b> table.  Because the query
does not contain filters, the results preserve every row from the
dominant table.
</P>

<H3> Query 3 </H3>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT customer.customer_num, company, order_num, ship_date
    FROM customer, OUTER orders

<P>
The preceeding example queries two tables in the simplest type of outer
join.  You can, in fact, use outer joins to query any number of tables,
producing more types of joins than can be discussed here.  The following
types are possible when three tables are involved in a query:
</P>

<BL>
<LI>
You can outer-join the result of a simple join to a third table.
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT <i>column-list</i>
    FROM x, OUTER (y, z)
    WHERE x.a = y.a
      AND y.b = z.b
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<A HREF="#query4">Query 4</A> performs this kind of join.  (See the
sections "Examples" later in this chapter.)
</LI>

<LI>
You can outer-join the result of an outer join to a third table.
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT <i>column-list</i>
    FROM x, OUTER (y, OUTER z)
    WHERE x.a = y.a
      AND y.b = z.b
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
or
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT <i>column-list</i>
    FROM x, OUTER (y, OUTER z)
    WHERE x.a = z.a     <i>-- different join here!</i>
      AND y.b = z.b
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<A HREF="#query5">Query 5</A> and
<A HREF="#query6">Query 6</A>
perform this kind of join.  (See the sections "Examples" later in this chapter.)
</LI>

<LI>
You can outer-join two tables individually to a third tables, in which
case, join relationships are possible only between the subservient
tables and the dominant tables.  <A HREF="#query7">Query 7</A> performs
this kind of join.  (See the sections "Examples" later in this chapter.)

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT <i>column-list</i>
    FROM x, OUTER y, OUTER z
    WHERE x.a = y.a
      AND x.b = z.b
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

When you outer-join several tables to another table, make sure that your
WHERE clause does not attempt to specify impossible join conditions.
The following query attempts a join between two subservient tables:

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT <i>column-list</i>
    FROM x, OUTER y, OUTER z
    WHERE x.a = y.a
      AND y.b = z.b
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
An error results: every outer join must have a dominant table.
</LI>

</BL>

The following examples use the stores database to demonstrate common
multi-table outer joins.

<H1> Examples </H1>

<A NAME="query4"></A>
<H2> Query 4 </H2>

This query outer-joins the result of a simple join to a third table.  It
produces a list of all customers with supplemental information (order
number, stock number, manufacturer code, and quantity ordered) for those
customers who ordered items manufactured by Anza.

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE><PRE>
SELECT customer.customer_num, lname, orders.order_num, stock_num, manu_code, quantity
    FROM customer, OUTER(orders, items)
    WHERE customer.customer_num = orders.customer_num
      AND orders.order_num = items.order_num
      AND manu_code = 'ANZ'
</PRE></CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>
4GL performs the simple join between <b>orders</b> and <b>items</b>
first, yielding information on all orders for ANZA-manufactured items.
The outer join combines the <b>customer</b> table with the Anza order
information.  The query results do not include orders for other items.

To preserve notes for customers 108 and 118 who do not have orders, you
must outer-join the <b>custnotes</b> table <i>directly</i> with the
<b>customer</b> table, as shown in the next query.

<A NAME="query7"></A>
<H2> Query 7 </H2>

This query outer-joins two tables individually to a third table.  It
outer joins both <b>orders</b> and <A
HREF="#custnotes"><b>custnotes</b></A> to <b>customer</b> (the dominant
table).

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<CODE> <PRE>
SELECT customer.customer_num, orders.order_num, notes
    FROM customer, OUTER orders, OUTER custnotes
    WHERE customer.customer_num = orders.order_num
      AND customer.customer_num = custnotes.customer_num
</PRE> </CODE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

Cusomer notes now appear, regardless of whether customers have orders.

<P>
All of the preceding queries fetch information from one table with
supplemental information from other tables.  When you need similar
results, Informix recommends that you use an outer join.  When you do not
need supplemental information, as is normally the case, use a simple
join instead.
</P>

<P>
Be aware that your choice of an outer join can influence query
optimization and processing.  You can use the SET EXPLAIN ON statement
to examine how the query processor of Informix-4GL performs simple
queries, joins and outer joins.

<H2> An Extreme Case </H2>

Once upon a long time ago (are you sitting comfortably?), there was a
system running on Informix-Turbo (the predecessor to Informix-OnLine).
The views were rather substantial.  This is the text of a create view
actually encountered on the Turbo system, prettified for presentation.

<CODE> <PRE>
CREATE VIEW IBB_V_Project AS
    SELECT  A.Project_Iref,
            A.Section_Iref,
            B.Section_Eref,
            N.Company_Iref,
            N.Company_Name,
            A.Product_Desc,
            A.Project_Type_Iref,
            D.Project_Type,
            A.Person_Iref,
            F.Full_Name,
            A.Respon_Iref,
            G.Post_Location,
            A.Project_Stat_Iref,
            E.Project_Status,
            A.Source_Iref,
            I.Source,
            A.Sic_Iref,
            L.Sic_Eref,
            A.Op_Activity_Iref,
            M.Op_Activity_Desc,
            A.Involve_Iref,
            K.IBB_Involvement,
            A.Nature_Iref,
            C.Nature_Of_Next_Act,
            A.Internat_Mobile,
            A.Whether_Cop_Case,
            A.Closed_Ind,
            A.Next_Action_Date,
            A.Creation_Date,
            A.Last_Edit_Date,
            A.Last_Editor_Iref,
            H.Logname

    FROM    IBB_Project A,
            IBB_Section B,
            IBB_R_Proj_Type D,
            IBB_R_Project_Stat E,
            IBB_Personnel H,
            OUTER IBB_R_Next_Act C,
            OUTER IBB_Personnel F,
            OUTER (IBB_Post_Respon X, OUTER IBB_V_Post_Resp2 G),
            OUTER IBB_R_Source I,
            OUTER IBB_R_Involvement K,
            OUTER IBB_Sic L,
            OUTER IBB_Op_Act M,
            OUTER IBB_V_Proj_Co2 N

    WHERE   A.Section_Iref      = B.Section_Iref
      AND   A.Project_Type_Iref = D.Project_Type_Iref
      AND   A.Project_Stat_Iref = E.Project_Stat_Iref
      AND   A.Last_Editor_Iref  = H.Person_Iref
      AND   A.Nature_Iref       = C.Nature_Iref
      AND   A.Person_Iref       = F.Person_Iref
      AND   A.Respon_Iref       = X.Respon_Iref
      AND   X.Respon_Iref       = G.Person_Iref
      AND   A.Source_Iref       = I.Source_Iref
      AND   A.Sic_Iref          = L.Sic_Iref
      AND   A.Op_Activity_Iref  = M.Op_Activity_Iref
      AND   A.Project_Iref      = N.Project_Iref
      AND   A.Involve_Iref      = K.Involve_Iref;
</PRE> </CODE>

Note that IBB_V_Post_Resp2 and IBB_V_Proj_Co2 are both themselves views.
In fact, IBB_V_Proj_Co2 was a 3-table view, exact details unknown but of
the form:

<CODE> <PRE>
CREATE VIEW IBB_V_Proj_Co2 AS
    SELECT  A.Project_Iref,
            A.Some_Other_Col col01,
            B.Xxxx_Iref,
            B.Some_Other_Col col02,
            C.Yyyy_Iref,
            C.Some_Other_Col col03
    FROM    IBB_Project A,
            OUTER (IBB_R_Xxxx B, IBB_R_Yyyy C)
    WHERE   A.Xxxx_Iref = B.Xxxx_IrEf
      AND   B.Yyyy_Iref = C.Yyyy_Iref;
</PRE> </CODE>

This means that the IBB_V_Project view has an outer self-join on
IBB_Project.  The IBB_V_Post_Resp2 view involved 3 tables too, somewhat
like:

<CODE> <PRE>
CREATE VIEW IBB_V_Post_Resp2 AS
    SELECT  A.Person_Iref,
            A.Some_Other_Col col01,
            B.Xxxx_Iref,
            B.Some_Other_Col col02,
            C.Yyyy_Iref,
            C.Some_Other_Col col03
    FROM    IBB_Personnel A,
            IBB_R_Xxxx B,
            IBB_R_Yyyy C
    WHERE   A.Xxxx_Iref = B.Xxxx_Iref
      AND   B.Yyyy_Iref = C.Yyyy_Iref;
</PRE> </CODE>

The Zzzz_Iref columns were either SERIAL or INTEGER foreign keys
referencing a SERIAL key.

<P>
The primary view definition refers to 14 tables, with 4 inner joins and 9
outer joins.  When the cross-referenced views are taken into account, there
are 18 tables in total, with 7 inner joins and 10 outer joins.
The view was constructed semi-automatically by a database schema design tool.
</P>

<HR WIDTH=80%>

The diagrams for these views could be summarized as:

<H3>IBB_V_Project</H3>
Of necessity, this diagram uses the table aliases rather than the table names.
